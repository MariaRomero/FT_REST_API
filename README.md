# FT_REST_API
Node.js tech test

This is a CRUD REST API where
An organisation has the following properties:
● Name
● Year founded
● Revenue

It's Node.js and a MongoDB/ using Mongoose as the object modeling tool, with a set of HTTP endpoints for creating, reading, updating and deleting organisations.

Next Step would be to create tests using Mocha and Chai, but because of Time constrains I will be submitting it without them.
